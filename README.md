##Site for students
#######There are 4 roles: guest, student, admin and main admin. If the email is not in the student database, then it becomes a guest, in the functionality it is possible to view all the data (for example: timetable, subjects, grades, news), but you cannot change / delete the data and you cannot see the full name of the student, only his first letter, and the student's email is hidden. If otherwise, there is mail in the database, then you can do everything except changing / deleting data from the database. For the admin and the main admin, there is a special mail and password, respectively, if we go under the admin, then we will have the same functionality as the student, but now we can change the data and delete some, for the main admin it is similar to just the admin, but plus you can still delete / change absolutely all the data that is provided for by this project.
